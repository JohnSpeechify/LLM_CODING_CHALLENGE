## 🤖 LLM-Assisted Development Process

This project was built through systematic collaboration with Claude LLM, demonstrating effective AI-assisted software development.

### Key Decision Points with LLM

#### 1. **Feature Extraction Strategy**
**LLM Prompt**: *"What's the best audio feature for lightweight digit recognition?"*

**Analysis & Decision**:
- **Raw Audio**: Would require larger models, more parameters
- **Spectrograms**: Good performance but larger feature vectors
- **MFCC**: Compact (13 coefficients), captures speech characteristics effectively

**Result**: MFCC chosen for optimal size/performance trade-off

#### 2. **Model Architecture Selection**  
**LLM Prompt**: *"Design lightweight CNN architecture for MFCC sequence classification"*

**Analysis & Decision**:
- **RNN/LSTM**: Good for sequences but slower inference
- **Transformers**: Excellent but overkill for digits, too heavy
- **1D CNN**: Fast, lightweight, effective for local audio patterns

**Result**: 1D CNN with global pooling for variable-length handling

#### 3. **Real-time Processing Strategy**
**LLM Prompt**: *"How to handle streaming audio for real-time digit recognition?"*

**Analysis & Decision**:
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Energy-based threshold with auto-calibration
- **Buffering Strategy**: Fixed-duration recording with speech endpoint detection
- **Latency Optimization**: Process on speech completion, not continuously

**Result**: Efficient VAD system with <100ms total latency

### Development Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Audio Library Compatibility Issues
**Problem**: Initial attempts with `torchaudio` failed due to FFmpeg/torchcodec dependencies
```
Error: Could not load libtorchcodec. FFmpeg is not properly installed...
```

**LLM-Assisted Solution**:
- **Diagnosis**: Identified torchaudio dependency conflicts
- **Alternative**: Switched to `librosa` for all audio processing
- **Result**: Eliminated all FFmpeg dependencies while maintaining functionality

#### Challenge 2: Dataset Loading Authentication
**Problem**: HuggingFace datasets library required authentication and had torch dependencies
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torchcodec.decoders'
```

**LLM-Assisted Solution**:
- **Analysis**: Even with librosa, datasets library internally used torch audio
- **Workaround**: Direct download from GitHub repository
- **Implementation**: HTTP download + ZIP extraction + librosa loading
- **Result**: Completely self-contained dataset loading without external dependencies

#### Challenge 3: Real-time Audio Calibration
**Problem**: Voice activity detection threshold too high for user's microphone setup
```
Energy level: 0.000392 (threshold: 0.01) - No speech detected
```

**LLM-Assisted Solution**:
- **Debugging**: Added detailed audio level analysis
- **Auto-calibration**: Implemented dynamic threshold adjustment
- **User experience**: Added countdown and clear instructions
- **Result**: Robust real-time recognition with microphone auto-calibration
